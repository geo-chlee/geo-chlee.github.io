    "text": "Co-work: Sunmin Hong\n1. Start drafting a research project framework:\na. Identify a topic of interest\nOur topic is identifying the characteristics of criminals who engage in phishing crimes in South Korea. Specifically, they will be divided into several groups based on their sociodemographic characteristics and crime participation path as variables. After that, a risk group with the highest distribution of all variables will be selected, and crime risk factors based on their characteristics will be displayed.\nb. Write up the research question\n\nUnsupervised Learning 1: What socio-economic variable are classified based on the characteristics of fishing criminals?\nUnsupervised learning 2: What is the distribution of the difference in the influence of variables that contribute to dividing the characteristics of criminals?\nSupervised Learning 1: What is the statistical relationship of the most influential. variable with other variables? (regression)\nSupervised Learning 2: How to create a model for predicting variables with great influence?\n\nc. Do you have a dependent variable?\nWe will find the most influential variable through unsupervised learning and use that. variable as a dependent variable to find the most suitable model through supervised. learning.\nd. What is the hypothes is?\nAfter analyzing existing studies on criminals who engage in cybercrime, especially. phishing, we will create hypotheses related to the characteristics of criminals who engage in phishing.\n2. Six steps in research:\na. Topic identification/Motivation\nAs a result of collecting data on demographic characteristics and crime participation. paths of criminals who participated in phishing crimes in South Korea, the information to be set as variables could be classified into their participation path, gender, age, criminal record, occupation, and education. After creating several groups that engage in phishing crimes based on this information, we will reveal what characteristics the most dangerous groups have.\nb. Systematic Literature Review/Meta Analysis\nIn progress\nc. Model of Interest: Data-based, Algorithm-based or Hybrid\nWe will use a data-driven model using information about the characteristics of criminals involved in phishing crimes.\nd. Data Collection and Management\nWe have already obtained data containing information about the characteristics of criminals involved in phishing crimes, and after processing the missing data, we will proceed with the aforementioned procedure.\ne. Writing tool (e.g. LaTeX, Markdown/quarto, overleaf, MathJax)\nWe will use programs such as LaTex or Overleaf that show publication-level quality to reveal the characteristics of the phishing offender.\nf. Findings interpreted (e.g. models, data visualization)\nWe will use the visualization method that best represents the results for different groups , including the most risky group mentioned above."

The report includes a map to illustrate the geographical impacts of the earthquake using various symbols and colors. However, the map does not effectively convey the information for the following reasons:\n\nLack of Legend or Descriptive Labels: There is no legend or description provided to help readers interpret the map. This is particularly problematic for the two blue lines, which are positioned in the inner and outer areas of the map but are not explained. The map leaves viewers unclear about what these lines represent. Although the data itself is reliable (as it comes from the US Geological Survey, which uses seismic sensors and geophysical tools), the chart’s design fails to communicate this data clearly.\n\nMisleading Representation of Earthquake Effects: While the chart visually depicts the earthquake’s location and potentially affected areas, the use of concentric circles could mislead viewers. It might suggest that the earthquake’s effects are evenly distributed, which is rarely the case. In reality, earthquake intensity decreases significantly as you move farther from the epicenter. A more accurate visualization would use gradients or nuanced shading to reflect this variation in intensity.\n\nDesign Flaws in the Map��s Visual Grammar:\n\nPoor Design: The map could be improved by including a legend that explains what each color and ring represents, such as earthquake intensity or magnitude. The absence of gridlines for latitude and longitude also makes it difficult to determine the exact location of the epicenter and its relation to surrounding areas.\nColor Choices: The current colors, primarily shades of blue and green, may seem intuitive but are not labeled or differentiated clearly. If these circles are meant to represent varying seismic intensities, the color contrast should be sharper, with more distinct shades to represent different levels of severity.\nMinimal Labels: The map lacks key information, such as the earthquake’s magnitude, depth, and exact time. These details are crucial to understanding the event and should be included in the graphic. Additionally, cities or towns within the affected areas should be labeled more prominently to give a clearer sense of the earthquake’s impact on populated regions.\nScale: The map’s scale seems suitable for displaying the regional impacts of the earthquake, but it lacks a scale bar to indicate distances. This makes it difficult to assess how far the seismic effects extended from the epicenter. Including a scale in miles or kilometers would improve viewers�� understanding of the geographical scope of the event.\n\n\nIn summary, while the data is reliable, the design and presentation of the map fail to clearly communicate the earthquake’s impact. Improving the legend, color scheme, labeling, and scale would help make the map more informative and easier to interpret for viewers."
