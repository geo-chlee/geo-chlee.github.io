1.  **Try Anscombe's example**

```{r}

data(anscombe)  # Load Anscombe's data
View(anscombe) # View the data
summary(anscombe)

## Simple version
plot(anscombe$x1,anscombe$y1)


# Create four model objects
lm1 <- lm(y1 ~ x1, data=anscombe)
summary(lm1)
lm2 <- lm(y2 ~ x2, data=anscombe)
summary(lm2)
lm3 <- lm(y3 ~ x3, data=anscombe)
summary(lm3)
lm4 <- lm(y4 ~ x4, data=anscombe)
summary(lm4)
plot(anscombe$x1,anscombe$y1)
abline(coefficients(lm1))
plot(anscombe$x2,anscombe$y2)
abline(coefficients(lm2))
plot(anscombe$x3,anscombe$y3)
abline(coefficients(lm3))
plot(anscombe$x4,anscombe$y4)
abline(coefficients(lm4))


## Fancy version (per help file)

ff <- y ~ x
mods <- setNames(as.list(1:4), paste0("lm", 1:4))

# Plot using for loop
for(i in 1:4) {
  ff[2:3] <- lapply(paste0(c("y","x"), i), as.name)
  ## or   ff[[2]] <- as.name(paste0("y", i))
  ##      ff[[3]] <- as.name(paste0("x", i))
  mods[[i]] <- lmi <- lm(ff, data = anscombe)
  print(anova(lmi))
}

sapply(mods, coef)  # Note the use of this function
lapply(mods, function(fm) coef(summary(fm)))

# Preparing for the plots
op <- par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = 0.1+c(4,4,1,1), oma =  c(0, 0, 2, 0))

# Plot charts using for loop
for(i in 1:4) {
  ff[2:3] <- lapply(paste0(c("y","x"), i), as.name)
  plot(ff, data = anscombe, col = "red", pch = 21, bg = "orange", cex = 1.2,
       xlim = c(3, 19), ylim = c(3, 13))
  abline(mods[[i]], col = "blue")
}

3.  **Export the results after running Fall.R**

1\) Generate data to visualize

```{r}

library(gsubfn)

# Each image corresponds to a different axiom, rules, angle and depth

# Leaf of Fall

This NBC Dallas News report covers an earthquake that occurred in Martin County at 7:49 p.m., approximately 21 miles southwest of Ackerly, Texas. The report includes a map to illustrate the geographical impacts of the earthquake using various symbols and colors. However, the map does not effectively convey the information for the following reasons:

1.  **Lack of Legend or Descriptive Labels**: There is no legend or description provided to help readers interpret the map. This is particularly problematic for the two blue lines, which are positioned in the inner and outer areas of the map but are not explained. The map leaves viewers unclear about what these lines represent. Although the data itself is reliable (as it comes from the US Geological Survey, which uses seismic sensors and geophysical tools), the chart's design fails to communicate this data clearly.

    -   **Misleading Representation of Earthquake Effects**: While the chart visually depicts the earthquake's location and potentially affected areas, the use of concentric circles could mislead viewers. It might suggest that the earthquake's effects are evenly distributed, which is rarely the case. In reality, earthquake intensity decreases significantly as you move farther from the epicenter. A more accurate visualization would use gradients or nuanced shading to reflect this variation in intensity.

2.  **Design Flaws in the Map¡¯s Visual Grammar**:

    -   **Poor Design**: The map could be improved by including a legend that explains what each color and ring represents, such as earthquake intensity or magnitude. The absence of gridlines for latitude and longitude also makes it difficult to determine the exact location of the epicenter and its relation to surrounding areas.

    -   **Color Choices**: The current colors, primarily shades of blue and green, may seem intuitive but are not labeled or differentiated clearly. If these circles are meant to represent varying seismic intensities, the color contrast should be sharper, with more distinct shades to represent different levels of severity.

    -   **Minimal Labels**: The map lacks key information, such as the earthquake's magnitude, depth, and exact time. These details are crucial to understanding the event and should be included in the graphic. Additionally, cities or towns within the affected areas should be labeled more prominently to give a clearer sense of the earthquake's impact on populated regions.

    -   **Scale**: The map's scale seems suitable for displaying the regional impacts of the earthquake, but it lacks a scale bar to indicate distances. This makes it difficult to assess how far the seismic effects extended from the epicenter. Including a scale in miles or kilometers would improve viewers¡¯ understanding of the geographical scope of the event.

In summary, while the data is reliable, the design and presentation of the map fail to clearly communicate the earthquake's impact. Improving the legend, color scheme, labeling, and scale would help make the map more informative and easier to interpret for viewers.
